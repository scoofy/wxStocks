This program is now in beta (let's be honest, it'll always be in beta until i write some tests), but i'm still happy to accept any pull requests or suggestions if you want to help out.

wxStocks is a investment analysis program that could help teach you to scrape, screen, sort, and prepare a portfolio for learning about buying and selling equities.

The biggest new feature is XBRL support!

Built using wx as its framework (specifically wxPython3.0-osx-cocoa-py2.7), and pyql as its scraping tool.

Requirements: Python 3, [wxPython 4](https://wxpython.org/pages/downloads/index.html), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org), Requests, bs4, and some other stuff i should probably list here but you can get them with pip

Recommended: [python cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/), [xlrd](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd)

Installation:

Python:

If you are running a mac or linux Python 3. To check, open your terminal and just type "python", which should lead to a prompt that looks like ">>>". You can then quit by typing "quit()". If that doesn't work, go here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

If you are running windows, i've found it's better to install 64-bit python if you're on a 64-bit processor for this program, go here and install python 3, ideally the latest release: https://www.python.org/downloads/

wxPython:

http://www.wxpython.org/download.php

Just use pip: $ pip install wxpython

Numpy:

$ pip install numpy

http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html

Python cryptography library (not required, but highly recommended):
